Plan (concise, phase-by-phase)

Phase 1 — Done

Basic CLI parser for failed logins.
Phase 2 — Done

Base parser utilities (read_lines, extract_ip).
ApacheParser, LinuxAuthParser.
Log format auto-detection.
Phase 3 — Done

UnifiedParser to standardize events.
Frequency analytics for IPs/users/URLs.
Security detection rules (brute-force, suspicious activity).
Phase 4 — Done

Alert engine with normalized events and risk scoring.
Time-window detectors for IPs and users.
UI improvements and live-monitor preferences.
Email notifier UX: persistent config (config.py), interactive registration (ui.py), --email-test, runtime password prompt, HTML emails + alert.json attachment.
Phase 5 — Remaining (prioritized)
Next: implement Phase 5.1 → integrate keyring to avoid plaintext passwords. (security first)
Then: Phase 5.3 → persist alerts and add JSON export (alerts.json) so data is exportable.
Then: Phase 5.2 → add retry/backoff + structured logging for reliable delivery and observability.
Then: Phase 5.4–5.5 → add tests, CI, package CLI and write quickstart docs.
After those PHASE 6 , build Docker support and the professional README.
